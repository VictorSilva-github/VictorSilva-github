<br/>I'm a Full Stack Developer in web development. 
I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from an IT College in Dublin,
Ireland in 2021. For my final essay, I built a game in Java 
to demonstrate my programming skills and creativity.

Currently, I'm focused on studying backend (Python and C#) and frontend (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) technologies.
I'm passionate about creating user-friendly interfaces and robust server-side applications.

With a detail-oriented approach and problem-solving mindset, I deliver high-quality solutions.
I'm proficient in version control systems like Git and enjoy collaborating with others.

I'm a lifelong learner, always seeking growth opportunities.
Let's connect and discuss how I can contribute to your projects and bring your ideas to life.
